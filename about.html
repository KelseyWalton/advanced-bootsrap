      <p>
        I moved to Nashville in 2019 from Indiana. I went to school for
        ELementary Education. I taught Pre-K for two years and am currently a
        full time nanny. I took interest into coding because I wanted to learn
        something new and add more for my future goals. I am excited to learn
        coding and can't wait to see where it takes me.
